### Components
- SEEED STUDIO XIAO ESP32S3 SENSE
- OV2640 Camera Module (Texture Imaging Sensor)
- VEML7700 (Lux Sensor)
- Button(6x6mm)
- MicroSD Card Module

### Communication
- **Bluetooth Communication Setup**:
  - Configure the ESP32's Bluetooth module as a Bluetooth transmitter.
  - Implement a protocol to send captured images, color data (RGB), and lux readings.
- **Sensor Integration**:
  - Connect VEML7700 to the ESP32 using I2C or SPI, depending on the sensorâ€™s interface.
- **Data Processing**:
  - Program the ESP32 to process sensor data, resize images, and package this data for Bluetooth transmission.
- **Power Supply**:
  - Connect the VCC of all components to a suitable power source, ensuring compatibility with their voltage requirements.
- **Ground (GND)**:
  - Connect the GND of all components together to ensure a common ground reference.

### **Programming**:
- Program to handle image capture, color detection, lux measurement, and Bluetooth data transmission.

  - Implement a protocol to receive data (images and lux readings) from the Sensor Device.
- **Display and Actuator Control**:
  - Interface the ESP32 with the ILI9341 2.8" SPI TFT LCD via SPI for image display.
  - Connect and program the stepper motor and LEDs to respond to received data (e.g., lux readings and color data).
- **Power Supply**:
  - Connect the VCC of all components to a suitable power source, ensuring compatibility with their voltage requirements.
- **Ground (GND)**:
  - Connect the GND of all components together to ensure a common ground reference.
 
### General Connectivity:
- **Bluetooth Communication**:
  - Set up ESP32S3 SENSE to transmit image data and lux readings over Bluetooth.
  - Configure ESP32S3 Wi-Fi/B to receive this data and process it accordingly.
- **SPI Connection for ST7789 TFT LCD**:
  - Use SPI pins on ESP32S3 Wi-Fi/B to interface with the LCD.

### Programming:
- Program to receive Bluetooth data, control the stepper motor, update LEDs, and display images and RGB values on the LCD.

### Testing and Validation:
- Test the Bluetooth communication to ensure data is accurately sent and received.
- Validate the functionality of the stepper motor and LEDs based on the received data.
- Check the display quality and responsiveness of the ST7789 TFT LCD.
